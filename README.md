2) Open one of the controller's tab (e.g. user-controller).
3) Choose the desired operation (e.g. PUT /api/users).
4) In "Parameters" section, click "Try it out".
5) Set desired parameters and click "Execute".

You will see your request and a response from the API below.
#### Postman
You will need Postman (https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
1) Create a new Collection and name it.
2) Click your new Collection with the right mouse button and select "Add request".
3) Choose one of the REST operations and enter the request URL like in the example below:

* GET http://localhost:8080/api/groups
    - returns the list of technological groups (this function is not available yet)\
      Parameters: None
      

or:
* GET http://localhost:8080/api/users?firstName=Anna
    - search for a user (this function is not available yet)\
      Parameters: firstName, lastName, userName


4) Click "Send" and you will see a response from the API below.

#### Docker

1) Run container in detached mode, by call:

```output
docker-compose up -d
```

2) Check, if container was created correctly.

To list containers related to images declared in `docker-compose file` call:

```output
docker-compose ps
```

To list all running Docker containers, open your command prompt and call:

```output
docker ps
```

To list all containers (running and stopped), call:

```output
docker ps â€“a
```

You should be able to see container named ```patronative_db```

3) To list created volumes, call:

```
docker volume ls
```

You should see volume named ```patronage21-java_pgdata```

4) To see informations about the volume:

```output
docker volume inspect patronage21-java_pgdata
```

It returns configuration in JSON format:

```

    {
        "CreatedAt": "2021-04-09T14:05:56Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {
            "com.docker.compose.project": "patronage21-java",
            "com.docker.compose.version": "1.28.5",
            "com.docker.compose.volume": "pgdata"
        },
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/patronage21-java_pgdata/_data",
        "Name": "patronage21-java_pgdata",
        "Options": null,
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
```

3) Stop the container:

```output
docker container stop patronative_db
```

Stop and remove all containers created by `docker-compose up`:

```output
docker-compose down
```
